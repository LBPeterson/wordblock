# wordblock
Chrome extension to censor selected words on a webpage

This is just a personal project inspired by cloud-to-butt and ublock

Potential uses so far:
  Blocking brand names from webpages
  Blocking trigger words from webpages
  Blocking names of characters to prevent spoilers of books/movies/tv
